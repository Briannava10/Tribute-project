            <h3>Here's a the time line of Kobe Bryant life</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1996 NBA draft</strong> - Before the 1996 NBA draft, Bryant had worked out in Los Angeles, where he scrimmaged against former Lakers players Larry Drew and Michael Cooper and, according to then-Laker manager Jerry West, "marched over these people".</li>
                    <li><strong>Adjusting to the NBA (1996–1999)
                    </strong>- Bryant debuted in the Summer Pro League in Long Beach, California, scoring 25 points in front of a standing-room-only crowd. Defenders struggled to get in front of him, and his performance excited West and Lakers coach Del Harris.[47] He scored 36 points in the finale and finished with averages of 24.5 points and 5.3 rebounds in four games.[48] As a rookie in 1996–97, Bryant mostly came off the bench behind guards Eddie Jones and Nick Van Exel.[49] At the time he became the youngest player ever to play in an NBA game (18 years, 72 days; a record since broken by Jermaine O'Neal and former teammate Andrew Bynum), and also became the youngest NBA starter (18 years, 158 days).[50][51] Initially, Bryant played limited minutes, but as the season continued, he began to see some more playing time.
                   </li>
                    <li><strong>Three-peat (1999–2002)</strong> - Bryant's fortunes would improve when Phil Jackson took over as coach of the Lakers in 1999.[64] After years of steady improvement, Bryant became one of the premier shooting guards in the league, earning appearances in the league's All-NBA,[65] All-Star, and All-Defensive teams.[66] The Lakers became championship contenders under Bryant and O'Neal, who formed a legendary center-guard combination. Jackson utilized the triangle offense that he implemented to win six championships with the Chicago Bulls; this offense would help both Bryant and O'Neal rise to the elite class of the NBA. Three championships were won consecutively in 2000, 2001, and 2002, further cementing this view.[67]</li>
                    <li><strong>Coming up short (2002-2004)
                    </strong>- In the first game of the 2002–03 season, Bryant recorded 27 points, 10 rebounds, 5 assists and 4 steals in an 87–82 loss to the visiting Spurs.[84] On November 1, Bryant recorded a triple-double of 33 points, 15 rebounds and 12 assists in a 108–93 win over the LA Clippers.[85] He also set an NBA record for three-pointers in a game on January 7, 2003, when he made 12 against the Seattle SuperSonics.[86] Bryant averaged 30 points per game and embarked on a historic run, posting 40 or more points in nine consecutive games while averaging 40.6 in the entire month of February. In addition, he averaged 6.9 rebounds, 5.9 assists, and 2.2 steals per game, all career-highs to that point.[9] Bryant was once again voted to both the All-NBA and All-Defensive first teams,[9] and came in third place in voting for the MVP award. After finishing 50–32 in the regular season, the Lakers floundered in the playoffs and lost in the Western Conference semi-finals in six games to the eventual NBA champions San Antonio Spurs.[87]</li>
